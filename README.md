### Hi, I'm Ash! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Technical Release Manager on the Labs team at BloomTech, formerly known as Lambda School. We build apps for nonprofits, and some of them are currently being used by thousands. I manage the creation, development, and testing of these applications. I have experience in React, JS, TS, and Python.
